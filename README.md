# Project
The final project of the data analytics course at ReDI School <br>
I was working on historical incidence and mortality cases of six different cancer types in Germany. The data were categorized based on the gender and age groups.
I investigated the trend of incidence and mortality cases over the years for different states and cancer types, as well as the influence of sex and age on the incidence and mortality rates.<br>
The notebook of my data analysis is "HistoricalCancerDataForGermany". The cancer dataset that I worked on is in the file folder with the title "Germany". The information on the map dataset is in the file folder with the title "Map_Germany".
